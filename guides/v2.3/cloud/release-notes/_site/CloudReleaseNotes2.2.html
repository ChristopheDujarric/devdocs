    <p><strong>Improvements to the  deployment process</strong>. This release includes new build and deployment variables. Users of earlier versions of  will note that MCC has been replaced by ece-tools and ece-patches, which allows for patching your  without requiring a full installation of base code and the patch. For more information, see <a href="/guides/v2.2/cloud/env/environment-vars_magento.html">Magento application environment variables</a>, <a href="/guides/v2.2/cloud/reference/cloud-composer.html">Composer</a>, and <a href="#deploy">Changes in Deployment</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Upgraded technology stack.</strong>   recommends Fastly 1.2.33 and dropped support for PHP 5.6 and Varnish 3.  We now support PHP 7.1 and Varnish 5, along with Redis 3.2 and MySQL 5.7. All <a href="/guides/v2.2/release-notes/thirdparty-mccloud.html">third-party libraries</a> have been upgraded to the latest stable version.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Pipeline deployment</strong>, a new deployment process, enables build and deployment stages to minimize production system downtime for site updates. This deployment expands on the previous Configuration Management for .

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bundled extensions</strong>. This release of Magento includes the first third-party extension that we are bundling with Magento Commerce – Magento Social. This extension establishes a connection between your store and your corporate Facebook account, and creates a page with products from your catalog.

  <li>
    <p><strong>Integrated Signifyd fraud protection</strong>.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Significant enhancements in platform security and developer experience</strong>. Security improvements include the removal of unserialize calls and protection of this functionality to increase resilence against dangerous code execution attacks. We have also continued to review and improve our protection against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Performance gains from improvements in indexing, cart, and cache operations</strong>. Customers can browse and shop on a storefront while indexers are running with no visible impact to their experience. Additionally, long-running indexers operate in batches to better manage memory and run times. Cart improvements enable a buyer to create a cart with more than 300 line items, and merchants can process a cart with at least 300 line items. Varnish cache configuration now includes saint and grace mode to ensure Varnish is always presenting a cached page to a shop’s customers.  Enhancements to cache invalidation logic and optimization of edge side include blocks for frequently changing data that significantly boost cache hit ratios.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Substantial contributions from our Community members</strong>. Our Community Engineering Team has been working with skilled and enthusiastic community members, and together they’ve added hundreds of pull requests to the Magento code base.

<h2 id="security">Security enhancements</h2>

<p>Magento 2.2.0 includes multiple security enhancements. Although this release includes these enhancements, no confirmed attacks related to these issues have occurred to date. However, certain vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited to access customer information or take over administrator sessions, so we recommend that you upgrade your Magento software to the latest version as soon as possible.</p>

<p>In general, we’ve removed serialize/unserialize from most the code to improve protection against remote code execution attacks. We’ve enhanced protection of code where use of object serialization or unserialization was unavoidable.  Additionally, we’ve increased our use of output escaping to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.</p>

<h2 id="deploy">Changes in Deployment</h2>

<p>When upgrading to  2.2, consider the following changes in deployment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">ADMIN_EMAIL</code> variable must be set. We require the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ADMIN_EMAIL</code> environment variable configured for deployments. You can set this variable through the Project Web Interface. This is required for new installations and upgrades. For instructions, see <a href="/guides/v2.2/cloud/before/before-project-owner.html">Add admin variables for Admin access</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Update and include <code class="highlighter-rouge">config.php</code> and add a list of all modules. If you use Configuration Management with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">config.local.php</code> file, you must create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">config.php</code> and add it to your code. For instructions, see <a href="/guides/v2.2/cloud/project/project-upgrade.html">Configuration Management and upgrading</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The command for generating <code class="highlighter-rouge">config.php</code> changed in 2.2 from <code class="highlighter-rouge">php bin/magento magento-cloud:scd-dump</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">php vendor/bin/m2-ece-scd-dump</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">.magento.app.yaml</code> has new build and deploy hooks. As part of your upgrade, you should update the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.magento.app.yaml</code> file with new build and deploy hooks and a set of environment variables. All actions completed by build and deploy are completed by these hooks. For instructions, see <a href="/guides/v2.2/cloud/project//project-upgrade.html#update-the-magentoappyaml-file">Update .magento.app.yaml</a>. For additional technical information, we have removed pre-deployment tasks, refined build and deploy tasks, and modified build and deploy variables.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The deploy variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">GENERATED_CODE_SYMLINK</code> has been removed. The generated folders <code class="highlighter-rouge">var/generation</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">var/di</code> have been moved to a <code class="highlighter-rouge">generated/</code> read-only directory. The folder <code class="highlighter-rouge">var/generation</code> is now <code class="highlighter-rouge">generated/code</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">var/di</code> is now <code class="highlighter-rouge">generated/metapackage</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the removal of <code class="highlighter-rouge">GENERATED_CODE_SYMLINK</code>, you cannot execute <code class="highlighter-rouge">setup:di:compile</code> directly on a server.</p>

<p>To test and implement your  upgrade, see <a href="/cloud/project/project-upgrade.html">Upgrade Magento Commerce (Cloud)</a>. We include upgrade paths and additional instructions for upgrading from 2.0.X and 2.1.X.</p>

<p>You can directly upgrade to  2.2 from the following versions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2.0.X versions: 2.0.14, 2.0.15, 2.0.16</li>
  <li>2.1.X versions: 2.1.7, 2.1.8, 2.1.9</li>
</ul>

<p>We have heavily tested and verified upgrades to 2.2 from the latest three versions of 2.0.X and 2.1.X.</p>

<p>You can attempt to upgrade from any version directly to  2.2. We cannot guarantee the results. For example, you should be able to upgrade from 2.0.10 or 2.1.4 directly to 2.2.</p>

<p>If you prefer a secured and verified upgrade path, you can upgrade to one of the verified and tested versions, then directly upgrade to 2.2. For example, you could upgrade from 2.0.10 to 2.0.14, then upgrade to 2.2.</p>
